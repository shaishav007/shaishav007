What I do? 
For the past 3 years, Iâ€™ve been diving deep into the technical side of modern e-commerce. I believe a website is just a small part of the bigger picture. Itâ€™s the backend systemsâ€”order fulfillment, analytics, marketing tool integrations, and dynamic content managementâ€”that really make everything work. At Roseate and Tiary, my focus has been on building and maintaining these complete solutions.

Qualifications?
- Bachelor's Degree in Engineering (graduated 2016)

Other causes I care about:-(community projects where I contributed in the past)
Bloom - A free, secure, and web-based trauma healing support service from Chayn. Since 2013, Chayn has reached over 500,000 survivors worldwide with our trauma-informed, survivor-centred, and intersectional approaches in utilizing open-source tech for positive social impact.
