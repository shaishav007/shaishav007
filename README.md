Shaishav here ðŸ‘‹ I am a Frontend Developer with a background in 3D art and animation. I learnt to code in python in my first job and then made it my own by using it to build animations in Blender. Recently, I graduated from a Frontend Development bootcamp where I spent hours building stuff in React and ThreeJS which are technologies I have come to love. My dad and grandfather both were doctors in rural India and I learnt the value of community service from them. I recently move to Canada where I work at a print shop. Helping elderly and non-tech savvy people interact with printers and interfaces brings me great joy.
